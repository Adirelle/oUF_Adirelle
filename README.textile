oUF_Adirelle provides both raid and single unit frames built on top of oUF.

This addon has been originally written for personal use and taste.
It borrows ideas from existing raid and unit frame addons.

It has been tested and includes specific settings for the following classes:
hunter, druid, paladin, warlock, priest, shaman, death knight. It should
obviously work fine with other classes as well.

I do not plan to add configuration options. Nevertheless, one can move
and resize the frames using the "/oufa" chat command.

Single unit frames and party/raid unit frames could be disabled separately by
disabling corresponding addons.

Though oUF_Adirelle embeds and uses some libraries, they are all optional and
could be safely removed (just delete the "libs" directory).
