oUF_Adirelle provides both raid and single unit frames built on top of oUF.

This addon has been originally written for personal use and taste. 
It borrows ideas from existing raid and unit frame addons.

It has been tested and includes specific settings for the following classes: 
hunter, druid, paladin, warlock, priest, shaman, death knight.

I do not plan to add configuration options. Nevertheless, one can easily move 
and resize the frames using the "/oufa" chat command.

Though oUF_Adirelle embeds and uses some libraries, they are all optional and 
could be safely removed (just delete the "libs" directory).
